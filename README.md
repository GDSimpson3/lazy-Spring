## How to install it?
It might help to download the file someplace other than your "downloads" folder so that when you have run out of storage and you do a **ctrl + a ==> delete**, it won't be a wonder when it suddenly disspears

### 1) Save it in a folder,
Make sure you copy the full path, i saved it a folder called "AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazyc" eg:

    /Users/username/AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazyc/lazyc.sh

### 2) Make it accesible throughout your shell,
Add an alias in your shell profile .zprofile/.zshrc/.bashrc

    alias lcc="sh /Users/gavinsimpson/AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazyc/lazyc.sh"

### 2) Enjoy.
I know that you prob can make your own, but here is my way of making it
